#### The [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) package manager is what we're using to manage the python dependencies

## steps to install a bds (bio data science) environment:

* be comfortable with command line unix
* download [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) for **Python 2.7** and your particular enviroment (osx or linux-64 for our packages)
* [install](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html) it
* run the script to create the dsb environment: **bash conda_create_bds.sh**
* wait patiently for things to download

and you're done. In order to use the environment you need to activate it: **source activate bds** or you can put that line into your .bashrc file to automatically do it each time you log in.

[Get started](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html) is a pretty good place to learn more about conda.


Enjoy your **bds**!
