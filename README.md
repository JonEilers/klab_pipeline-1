# name_this_shit
Combination of the good parts of DAP and package_compare. Clearly the name is, 
well, a placeholder.

**klab.process** is the only python package currently migrated. Will also include:
 * NCBI data and code
 * ref package validation
 * other stuff from DAP

Others will (probably) be:
 * **klab.translation**
    - importers and exporters to communicate with third party software
 * **klab.workflow**
    - currently sort of working with Drake, need to improve with either make or scikit-bio
 * **klab.analysis** 
    - diversity
 * **klab.plot** (graph?)
    - graphing routines to have some standards
    - bar
    - scatter
    - heatmap
 * **cookbook** (hatchet_job?)
    - one off code that might be useful for something
