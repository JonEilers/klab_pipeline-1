# name_this_shit
Combination of the good parts of DAP and package_compare. Clearly the name is, 
well, a placeholder.

## Migrated packages
 * **klab.process**
    - ref package validation
    - other stuff from DAP
 * **klab.analysis** - the good stuff, what happens after processing
    - diversity
 * **data**
    - NCBI data and code
 * **cookbook** - one-off code that was useful for something and might be again
    - mbari
    - seastar
    - junk_drawer - Ryan's quick dump of DAP code, to be organized later


## Other packages (probably)
 * **klab.translation**
    - importers and exporters to communicate with third party software
 * **klab.plot** (graph?)
    - graphing routines to have some standards
    - bar
    - scatter
    - heatmap
