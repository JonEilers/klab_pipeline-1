## Migrated packages
 * **klab.process**
    - jplace files -> pandas data frames
    - taxonmical lineage
    - derived information (counts, confidence type)
 * **klab.analysis** - the good stuff, what happens after processing
    - diversity
    - edpl 
 * **data**
    - NCBI data and code to fetch it
* **lib**
    - third party code    
 * **cookbook** - one-off code that was useful for something and might be again
    - **junk_drawer** - Ryan's quick dump of DAP code, to be organized later


## Other packages (probably)
 * **klab.translation**
    - importers and exporters to communicate with third party software
 * **klab.plot** (graph?)
    - graphing routines to have some standards
    - bar
